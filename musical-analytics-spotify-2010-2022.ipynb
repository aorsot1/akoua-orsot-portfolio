In so doing, there is now more traceability on the songs/albumns catching the most attention and popularity. With this newly found pool of data points, music and entertainment industry would be greatly served in leveraging data analytics to tailor the musical offering onto this market. \n\nIt will be our modest attempt to conduct different analyses onto this 2010-2022 Spotify dataset to enhance the quality of the dataset, explore a variety of questions, run some tests, and draw some insights.\n\nThe work of [James Chryssanthacopoulos](https://towardsdatascience.com/advanced-music-analytics-using-machine-learning-f344e4795bbc) was also a great inpsiration","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

To have a deeper understanding of the underlying information captured, will we rely on the following sources to shed light on the meaning of each feature. The following source was of great help: [SPOTONTRACK - What do the audio features mean?](https://help.spotontrack.com/article/what-do-the-audio-features-mean)\n\n* **Danceability**: describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.\n\n* **Energy**: representing a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\n \n* **Key**: Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\n\n* **Mode**: indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n\n* **Loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.\n\n* **Speechiness**: detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\n\n* **Acousticness**: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic; thus indicating the likelihood of electrical amplification.\n\n* **Instrumentalness**: whether a track contains no vocals. \"Ooh\" and \"aah\" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \"vocal\". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.\n\n* **Liveness**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. \n\n* **Valence**: describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n\n* **Tempo**: estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n\n* **Time Signature**: indicates how many counts are in each measure and which type of note will receive one count.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.
