In so doing, there is greater traceability on the songs/albumns catching the most attention and popularity. With this new found pool of data points, music and entertainment industry would be greatly served in leveraging data analytics to tailor the musical offering onto this market. \n\nIt will be our modest attempt to conduct different analyses onto this 2010-2022 Spotify dataset to enhance the quality of the dataset, explore a variety of questions, run some tests, and draw some insights.\n\nThe work of [James Chryssanthacopoulos](https://towardsdatascience.com/advanced-music-analytics-using-machine-learning-f344e4795bbc) was also a great inpsiration","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
